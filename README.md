## Workshop 1
- **Description:**
  
The analysis was carried out using a systemic approach to the competition, taking into account the concepts covered in the systems analysis and design course.
To this end, the general description, data, and regulations of the "Sweet Regression: Prediction of Chocolate Sale" competition were reviewed.

First, the system components were identified: inputs, processes, outputs, and constraints.

Each component was then examined in terms of its sensitivity to change.

Then, the potential effects of chaos and randomness were analyzed, considering both the stochastic nature of machine learning algorithms and the competitive dynamics imposed by the rules of participation.
Finally, the analysis concluded with the identification of strengths and weaknesses, highlighting the elements that make the competition suitable for a systemic study.
